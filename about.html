            <h1>WEBSITE OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>&emsp; &emsp; &ensp;The website we created offers a comprehensive exploration of search engines
                , designed to provide users with an in-depth understanding of the different 
                platforms available, their strengths, weaknesses, and unique features. It 
                serves as an informative guide for those curious about how search engines 
                function and how they differ in terms of usability, privacy, and innovation. 
                From well-established giants like Google, Bing, and Yahoo to more privacy-focused                     
                alternatives like DuckDuckGo and modern AI-powered browsers such as Microsoft Edge, 
                the site presents clear comparisons through interactive, hover-enabled information boxes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>&emsp; &emsp; &ensp;Each search engine's profile includes a detailed definition, key pros and cons, and 
                additional background information, ensuring users gain valuable insights into the purpose 
                and history behind these platforms. The inclusion of pros such as Google's comprehensive 
                index or DuckDuckGo's commitment to privacy, along with cons like privacy concerns or limited                     
                personalization, provides a balanced perspective that helps users make informed decisions 
                about which search engine best suits their needs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>&emsp; &emsp; &ensp;In our view, the site is more than just a resourceâ€”it is a dynamic educational tool that 
                simplifies complex information through an engaging and user-friendly design. The hover and other feature 
                enhances interactivity, encouraging users to explore the site intuitively and engage with content 
                in a visually appealing way. This project not only highlights the diversity within the search 
                engine ecosystem but also reflects my commitment to making technical information accessible and 
                relevant for a broader audience.
